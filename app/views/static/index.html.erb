<h2>Application Changelog</h2>

<h3>0.2.0</h3>

<p>At this point in the application development, we have a static HTML home
  page (this page). The page is rendered as bare HTML, because this release
  removes the internal application.html.erb while none is yet provided by the
  theme gem.
</p>

<p>The underlying theme gem has content in vendor/assets, but this content is
  only available by specifying files in the internal manifest.js</p>

<h3>0.1.1</h3>
